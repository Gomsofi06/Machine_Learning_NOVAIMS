            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the <b>GrantApp</b>, an innovative tool designed to help automate the decision-making process
            for workers' compensation claims. This app leverages the power of machine learning to assist the New York Workers' Compensation Board (WCB)
            in managing and reviewing claims more efficiently. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WCB has reviewed millions of claims over the years, but manually processing each one is a time-consuming and
            complex task. <b>GrantApp</b>* aims to automate this process by providing a <b>prediction model</b> that can help streamline the decision-making
            for new claims based on historical data.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this platform, you can navigate to different sections: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> - Problem</b>: Understand the problem we are addressing.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> - Prediction</b>: Get predictions for workers' compensation claims based on the model.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's dive into the app and explore how we can help make the claims process faster and more efficient!

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB)</b> is responsible for overseeing the administration of workers' compensation benefits.
            This includes benefits for injured workers, as well as compensation for disability, volunteer firefighters, ambulance workers, and civil defense workers. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WCB has reviewed more than <b>5 million claims</b> since the year 2000, which are submitted by workers who have experienced workplace injuries.
            Despite the significant effort invested in processing these claims, the manual review process is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to delays in claim decisions.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for automation arises to improve the speed and accuracy of decision-making. By automating the claim review process, we can help the WCB
            make faster and more reliable decisions, ensuring injured workers receive timely assistance.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where <b>GrantApp</b> comes in! Our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the outcomes of workers' compensation claims,
            streamlining the decision-making process and supporting the WCB's mission of delivering better service to injured workers.<br>

            its outcome. The model we use has been trained on historical data and is designed to assist the New York Workers' Compensation Board in making more efficient and accurate decisions.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get started, please provide the necessary details about the claim. Based on the input you provide, the model will predict the class in which the
            claim belongs to, helping the WCB make data-driven decisions and expedite the claims process.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our prediction model is based on historical claims data and uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate the results. While the predictions
            are designed to assist the WCB, they are not definitive decisions and should be used alongside human judgment in the claim review process.<br>
