            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the <b>GrantApp</b>, an innovative tool designed to help automate the decision-making process
            for workers' compensation claims. This app leverages the power of machine learning to assist the New York Workers' Compensation Board (WCB)
            in managing and reviewing claims more efficiently. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WCB has reviewed millions of claims over the years, but manually processing each one is a time-consuming and
            complex task. <b>GrantApp</b>* aims to automate this process by providing a <b>prediction model</b> that can help streamline the decision-making
            for new claims based on historical data.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this platform, you can navigate to different sections: <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> - Problem</b>: Understand the problem we are addressing.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> - Prediction</b>: Get predictions for workers' compensation claims based on the model.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's dive into the app and explore how we can help make the claims process faster and more efficient!

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB)</b> is responsible for overseeing the administration of workers' compensation benefits.
            This includes benefits for injured workers, as well as compensation for disability, volunteer firefighters, ambulance workers, and civil defense workers. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The WCB has reviewed more than <b>5 million claims</b> since the year 2000, which are submitted by workers who have experienced workplace injuries.
            Despite the significant effort invested in processing these claims, the manual review process is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to delays in claim decisions.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for automation arises to improve the speed and accuracy of decision-making. By automating the claim review process, we can help the WCB
            make faster and more reliable decisions, ensuring injured workers receive timely assistance.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where <b>GrantApp</b> comes in! Our goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the outcomes of workers' compensation claims,
            streamlining the decision-making process and supporting the WCB's mission of delivering better service to injured workers.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get started, please provide the necessary details about the claim. Based on the input you provide, the model will predict the class in which the
