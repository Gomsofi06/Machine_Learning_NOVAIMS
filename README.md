# Machine_Learning_NOVAIMS (24/25)

Projects for the Machine Learning course of the Master in Data Science at the NOVA IMS Faculty, Lisbon

Made in collaboration between **Sofia Espada**, **Ana Beatriz Farinha**, **Francisco Capontes**, **Rui Louren√ßo**

## To Grant or Not to Grant: Deciding on Compensation Benefits

### Goal of the Project:
1. Multiclass Classification Benchmarking
2. Model Optimization
3. Additional Insights

## GrantApp: Predicting Claim Injury Types

As part of the Open-Ended section of this project, **GrantApp** was developed to provide a simple and interactive way to predict "Claim Injury Type" based on user-input data.

### Features
- **User Input**: Enter new data directly through the app.
- **Prediction Engine**: Outputs a prediction for the claim's injury type using the trained model.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `OpenEnded` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/Gomsofi06/Machine_Learning_NOVAIMS.git)
   cd [<repository-name>](https://github.com/Gomsofi06/Machine_Learning_NOVAIMS.git)/OpenEnded
   
2. Ensure you have Streamlit installed. If not, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit

3. Run the app with the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run GrantApp.py
